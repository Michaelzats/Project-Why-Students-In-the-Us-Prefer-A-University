# Project Why Students In The Us Prefer A University
The goal of this study is to determine which aspects are most important to students when selecting their favourite American university. The number of applications, admissions, and enrollments, the cost of tuition and fees, and the sorts of degrees provided are some of the key questions for building this project.
